# ContinuumCMAES
Coupled Continuum Modeling and CMA-ES Method for Fitting Kinetic Parameters in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction. The files contained herein provide the COMSOL code and MATLAB functions required to couple CMA-ES to continuum theory to fit kinetic parameters in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Using the presented codebase will allow one to model the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to HCOO-, CO, and H2 on Ag or Sn catalysts, and quantify kinetic parameters (transfer coefficients, exchange current densities, and effective boundary layer thicknesses) utilizing the entire scope of collected experimental partial current density and with quantified uncertainty.
